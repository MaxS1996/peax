# About

PEAX (Performance Enhancing Adaptive eXecution) is an open-source framework designed to empower non-domain experts to optimize and deploy efficient AI solutions on embedded devices.
Our goal is to make advanced model optimizations and graph rewrites accessible to a broader range of developers, enabling them to improve the latency and efficiency of their embedded AI applications while maintaining prediction quality.

## Background and Motivation

As AI continues to proliferate in various industries, the need for efficient and adaptive deep learning techniques on resource-constrained devices has become increasingly important.
However, leveraging these techniques often requires significant expertise in machine learning and embedded systems.
PEAX aims to bridge this gap by providing a user-friendly framework that automates the process of model optimization and graph rewriting, making it easier for developers to deploy high-performance AI models on microcontrollers and other embedded devices.

## License

PEAX is open-source and available under the MIT License.
You can access the code on our GitHub repository, where you can also find documentation to get started.

## Target Audience

PEAX is designed for developers, researchers, and organizations working on embedded AI applications, regardless of their industry or application.
Our goal is to provide a flexible and adaptable framework that can be used in a wide range of scenarios.
