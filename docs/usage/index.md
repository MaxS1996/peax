# Using PEAX for Model Analysis

* the base ModelAnalysis class of the PEAX framework can already provide important info
* without any extension through additional reports
* the ModelAnalysis class contains information about the:
  * layer graph
    * as layer-level graph representation
    * as block-level graph reprsentation
  * the compute, memory and storage footprint of each layer
  * the estimated input data modality
  * the estimated model task (i.e. classification, regression, ...)
